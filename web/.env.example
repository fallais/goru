# Environment Configuration for Goname Web App

# Backend API URL
# This should point to your Go backend server
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
# OR alternatively, you can use:
# BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Example for production:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
# BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Note: 
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser
# - Regular environment variables are only available server-side
# - Our API config will check both for maximum flexibility
